          The team at "Fuel Stuff" is build up of dedicated hard working
          individuals ready to meet all demands. The "4353 Group", the name of
          the team, met after an instructor of a software desing class gave a
          group assingment to his students. By mere chance, Edwin Campuzano,
          Salman Hossein, Zain Momin, and Nhat Do found each other and thus
          began the beginning of the great company "Fuel Stuff".
